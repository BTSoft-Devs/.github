Here is a Notion for I4.0 projects: https://www.notion.so/Proyecto-Industria-4-0-1b77a416d1ff46f3a987478de3b4d061

**This is a work-in-progress Organization:**

- 🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
- 🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
- 👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
- 🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
- 🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
